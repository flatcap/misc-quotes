Samuel Taylor Coleridge
Biographia Literia: Satyrane's Letters
The character of a gentleman ... is frequently in England, rare in France, and
found, where it is found, in age or the latest period of manhood; while in
Germany the character is almost unknown.  But the proper antipode of a
gentleman is to be sought for among the Anglo-American (ital) democrats.
