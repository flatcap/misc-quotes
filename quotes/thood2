No!


    No sun - no moon!
    No morn - no noon -
No dawn - no dusk - no proper time of day -
    No sky - no earthly view -
    No distance looking blue -
No road - no street - no "t'other side of way" -
    No end to any Row -
    No indications where Crescents go -
    No top to any steeple -
No recogitions of familiar people -
    No courtesies for showing 'em -
    No knowing 'em -
No travelling at all - no locomotion,
No inkling of the way - no notion -
    "No go" = by land or ocean -
    No mail - no post -
No news from any foreign coast -
No Park - no Ring - no afternoon gentility -
    No company - no nobility -
No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease,
    No comfortable feel in any member -
No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,
    No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds, -
	November!
