A linguistics professor was lecturing to his class one day.

"In English," he said, "a double negative forms a positive. In some
languages though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative.
However," he pointed out, "there is no language wherein a double positive
can form a negative."

Here are some punctuation differences.

An English professor wrote the words, "woman without her man is nothing"
on the blackboard and directed his students to punctuate it correctly.

The men wrote: "Woman, without her man, is nothing."
The women wrote: "Woman!  Without her, man is nothing."

This is from a contest on Long Island.  The requirements were to use the
words Lewinsky and Kaczynski (the Unabomber) in a limerick.  Here are the
3
winners:

   Entry #1:

   There once was a gal named Lewinsky
   Who played on a flute like Stravinsky
   'Twas "Hail to the Chief"
   On this flute made of beef
   That stole the front page from Kaczynski.

   Entry #2:

   Said Bill Clinton to young Ms. Lewinsky
   We don't want to leave clues like Kaczynski,
   Since you look such a mess,
   Use the hem of your dress
   And wipe that stuff off of your chinsky.

   Entry #3:

   Lewinsky and Clinton have shown
   What Kaczynski must surely have known:
   That an intern is better
   Than a bomb in a letter
   Given the choice of how to be blown.
