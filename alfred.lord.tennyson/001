Alfred Lord Tennyson
1809-1892 The Charge of the Light Brigade (1854)
'Forward the Light Brigade!'
Was there a man dismay'd?
Not tho' the soldier knew
	Some one had blunder'd:
Their's not to make reply,
Their's not to reason why,
Their's but to do and die:
Into the Valley of Death
	Rode the six hundred.
Cannon to the right of them
Cannon to the left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volley'd and thunder'd.
