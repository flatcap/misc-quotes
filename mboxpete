A mathematical problem should be difficult in order to entice us, yet not completely inaccesible, lest it mock at our efforts.
David Hilbert

Mathematics is a game played according to certain rules with meaningless marks on paper.
David Hilbert

If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts;
but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.
Francis Bacon

A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.
If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are
made with ideas... The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the
poet's must be BEAUTIFUL... Beauty is the first test: there is no 
permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.
G. H. Hardy
