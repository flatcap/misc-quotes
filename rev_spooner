Port Shoem, by the Speverend Rooner:

     I've a gouse and harden in the country,
     An ace I call my plown;
     A treat I can replace to
     When I beed to knee alone.
     Ah, catterfly and butterpiller
     Perch on beafy lough,
     As I listen to the dats and cogs
     As they mark and they beow.
     Yes, wature here is nunderful,
     There is no weed for nerds,
     While silling by my windowflutter
     Biny little tirds.
