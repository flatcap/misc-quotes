And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
Said he _had_ hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East
That the ship would _not_ travel due West.

Nullius addictus iurane in verba magistri,
Quo me cumque rapit tempestus, deferor hospes.
Not bound to swear allegiance to any master,
wherever the wind takes me, I travel as a visitor.
Horace 65-8BC  Epistles

Why didst thou promise such a bounteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?

To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive,
and the true success is labour.

into the language, goeth to school, and not to travel.
